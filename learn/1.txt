 Chapter 5: Working with the File System in Node.js

Node.js provides robust, non-blocking I/O capabilities through its built-in fs (file system) module. This chapter is essential for engineers building CLI tools, data processors, loggers, or any application that interacts with the local file system.

---

 § 5.1 fs Module Introduction

Purpose:  
The fs module enables interaction with the file system—reading, writing, deleting, watching files/directories, and managing permissions.

Key Characteristics:
- Part of Node.js core (no npm install needed).
- Exposes both asynchronous (non-blocking) and synchronous (blocking) APIs.
- Built on top of libuv, Node.js’s C++ library for async I/O.
- All file paths are interpreted as UTF-8 strings (or Buffer for binary paths).

How to Import:
js
// CommonJS (default in Node.js < v14, still widely used)
const fs = require('fs');

// ES Modules (Node.js ≥12 with .mjs or "type": "module")
import fs from 'fs';
// Or use the promise-based version:
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';


Core Submodules:
- fs: Callback-based API
- fs/promises: Promise-based API (cleaner for modern async/await)
- fs.constants: File system constants (e.g., fs.constants.O_RDONLY)

Security Note:  
File system operations are subject to OS-level permissions. Always validate and sanitize user-provided paths to prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., ../../../etc/passwd).

> ✅ Best Practice: Use path.resolve() and path.normalize() to sanitize paths, or restrict operations to a known base directory.

 § 5.2 Synchronous vs Asynchronous File Operations

Understanding the trade-offs between sync and async I/O is critical for performance and scalability.

 Synchronous (fs.readFileSync, fs.writeFileSync, etc.)
- Blocks the event loop until the operation completes.
- Simpler control flow (no callbacks/promises).
- Use only in initialization scripts, CLI tools, or during app startup—never in request-handling code.

js
// Example: Blocking the main thread
const data = fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8');
console.log(data); // Execution halts here until file is read


When to Use:
- Loading configuration at startup.
- Writing test fixtures.
- Scripts that run once and exit.

Risks:
- Can cause 100% CPU stall for large files.
- Degrades throughput in concurrent environments (e.g., web servers).

---

 Asynchronous (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile, etc.)
- Non-blocking: Uses libuv thread pool to offload I/O.
- Returns immediately; result delivered via callback or promise.
- Essential for scalable, high-concurrency applications.

Callback Style:
js
fs.readFile('data.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});


Promise Style (Preferred):
js
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

try {
  const data = await readFile('data.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Read failed:', err);
}


Performance Notes:
- The libuv thread pool defaults to 4 threads (UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE).
- For heavy I/O workloads (e.g., processing thousands of files), consider increasing UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE (max 128):
  bash
  UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=16 node app.js
  
- For very high throughput, combine with streams (see later chapters).

> ✅ Engineer Recommendation: Always prefer async/promise APIs in application logic. Reserve sync APIs for edge cases like config loading.

 § 5.3 Reading and Writing Files

 Reading Files

Methods:
| Method | Returns | Use Case |
|-------|--------|--------|
| fs.readFile / fsPromises.readFile | Entire file as Buffer or string | Small to medium files (<100 MB) |
| fs.createReadStream | Stream | Large files, memory efficiency |

Example: Safe Read with Encoding & Error Handling
js
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

async function safeRead(filePath) {
  try {
    const content = await readFile(filePath, { encoding: 'utf8', flag: 'r' });
    return content;
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
      console.error(File not found: ${filePath});
    } else if (err.code === 'EACCES') {
      console.error(Permission denied: ${filePath});
    }
    throw err;
  }
}


Flags (common):
- 'r': Read (default)
- 'r+': Read/write
- 'rs': Read synchronous (bypass OS cache—rarely needed)

---

 Writing Files

Methods:
| Method | Behavior |
|-------|--------|
| fs.writeFile / fsPromises.writeFile | Overwrites entire file |
| fs.appendFile | Appends to end of file |
| fs.createWriteStream | Stream-based write (for large data) |

Example: Atomic Write (Avoid Partial Writes)
js
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
import { tmpdir } from 'os';
import { join } from 'path';

// Write to temp file, then rename (atomic on same filesystem)
async function atomicWrite(filePath, data) {
  const tempPath = join(tmpdir(), temp-${Date.now()}.tmp);
  await writeFile(tempPath, data);
  await fs.promises.rename(tempPath, filePath); // Atomic on POSIX
}


Options:
js
await writeFile('output.txt', 'Hello', {
  encoding: 'utf8',
  mode: 0o600,      // rw------- (owner only)
  flag: 'w'         // 'w' = truncate, 'a' = append
});


Critical Considerations:
1. Encoding: Always specify encoding ('utf8') to avoid Buffer surprises.
2. Permissions: Use mode to set file permissions (octal notation).
3. Disk Space: Writes can fail due to full disk—always handle ENOSPC.
4. Atomicity: Direct writeFile is not atomic. Use temp-file + rename for critical data.

---

 Advanced Patterns for Engineers

 1. Path Safety (Prevent Directory Traversal)
js
import { resolve, relative } from 'path';

function safePath(baseDir, userInput) {
  const resolved = resolve(baseDir, userInput);
  // Ensure resolved path is within baseDir
  if (relative(baseDir, resolved).startsWith('..')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid path');
  }
  return resolved;
}


 2. Resource Cleanup with try...finally
js
let fd;
try {
  fd = await fsPromises.open('log.txt', 'a');
  await fd.write('New log entry\n');
} finally {
  if (fd) await fd.close(); // Ensure file descriptor is released
}


 3. Monitoring File Changes
Use fs.watch() or fs.watchFile() for live reload (e.g., config hot-reload):
js
fs.watch('config.json', (eventType, filename) => {
  if (filename && eventType === 'change') {
    reloadConfig();
  }
});

> ⚠️ Note: fs.watch is OS-dependent and may not work reliably over networks (e.g., NFS). Consider chokidar for cross-platform robustness.

 Summary & Best Practices

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| API Style | Prefer fs/promises with async/await |
| Sync Usage | Only for startup/config—never in request paths |
| Error Handling | Always check err.code (e.g., ENOENT, EACCES) |
| Large Files | Use streams (createReadStream/createWriteStream) |
| Security | Sanitize paths; avoid user-controlled file names |
| Atomic Writes | Write to temp file → rename |
| Permissions | Explicitly set mode for sensitive files |

 What’s Next?
After mastering basic file I/O, engineers should explore:
- Streams (for memory-efficient processing)
- File system events (fs.watch)
- Directory operations (fs.readdir, fs.mkdir)
- Stat operations (fs.stat for file metadata)
